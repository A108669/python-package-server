	<p>This file isn't used by pip (at least in my version), although the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0503/">specification</a> states that it is (I have omitted the python_hello package and it still works). It is still useful from a discoverability point of view though, and being as it isn't used you can make it human friendly without worrying about whether it will still work with pip.</p>
	<p>Pip will look for directories using the normalised name of your package ('python-hello' in this case instead of 'python_hello'). More details in the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0503/#normalized-names">specification</a>.</p>
